## Launch and set up AMD MI100 server - with python-chi

At the beginning of the lease time for your bare metal server, we will bring up our GPU instance. We will use the `python-chi` Python API to Chameleon to provision our server.

We will execute the cells in this notebook inside the Chameleon Jupyter environment.

Run the following cell, and make sure the correct project is selected.

:::

::: {.cell .code}
```python
# runs in Chameleon Jupyter environment
from chi import server, context, lease
import os

context.version = "1.0"
context.choose_project()
context.choose_site(default="CHI@TACC")
```
:::

::: {.cell .markdown}

Change the string in the following cell to reflect the name of *your* lease (**with your own net ID**), then run it to get your lease:

:::

::: {.cell .code}
```python
# runs in Chameleon Jupyter environment
l = lease.get_lease(f"serve_model_netID")
l.show()
```
:::

::: {.cell .markdown}

The status should show as "ACTIVE" now that we are past the lease start time.

The rest of this notebook can be executed without any interactions from you, so at this point, you can save time by clicking on this cell, then selecting "Run" > "Run Selected Cell and All Below" from the Jupyter menu.

As the notebook executes, monitor its progress to make sure it does not get stuck on any execution error, and also to see what it is doing.

We will use the lease to bring up a server with the `CC-Ubuntu24.04-ROCm` disk image. (The default Ubuntu 24.04 kernel is not compatible with AMD GPUs on these nodes.)

> **Note**: the following cell brings up a server only if you do not already have one with the same name! (Regardless of its error state.) If you have a server in ERROR state already, delete it first in the Horizon GUI before you run this cell.

:::


::: {.cell .code}
```python
# runs in Chameleon Jupyter environment
username = os.getenv('USER') # all exp resources will have this prefix
s = server.Server(
    f"node-serve-model-{username}",
    reservation_id=l.node_reservations[0]["id"],
    image_name="CC-Ubuntu24.04-ROCm"
)
s.submit(idempotent=True)
```
:::

Note: security groups are not used at Chameleon bare metal sites, so we do not have to configure any security groups on this instance.

:::

::: {.cell .markdown}

Then, we will associate a floating IP with the instance, so that we can access it over SSH.

:::

::: {.cell .code}
```python
# runs in Chameleon Jupyter environment
s.associate_floating_ip()
```
:::

::: {.cell .code}
```python
# runs in Chameleon Jupyter environment
s.refresh()
s.check_connectivity()
```
:::

::: {.cell .markdown}

In the output below, make a note of the floating IP that has been assigned to your instance (in the "Addresses" row).

:::

::: {.cell .code}
```python
# runs in Chameleon Jupyter environment
s.refresh()
s.show(type="widget")
```

### Retrieve code and notebooks on the instance

Now, we can use `python-chi` to execute commands on the instance, to set it up. We will start by retrieving the code and other materials on the instance.

:::

::: {.cell .code}
```python
# runs in Chameleon Jupyter environment
s.execute("git clone https://github.com/teaching-on-testbeds/serve-model-chi")
```
:::

### Set up Docker

To run the serving and inference experiments in this lab, we will use Docker containers that already include the required runtime libraries. In this step, we set up Docker on the server so we can launch those containers.

:::

::: {.cell .code}
```python
# runs in Chameleon Jupyter environment
s.execute("curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | sudo sh")
s.execute("sudo groupadd -f docker; sudo usermod -aG docker $USER")
```
:::

::: {.cell .markdown}

### Check the AMD GPU setup

Run

:::

::: {.cell .code}
```python
# runs in Chameleon Jupyter environment
s.execute("rocm-smi")
```
:::

::: {.cell .markdown}

and verify that you can see the GPU.

## Open an SSH session

Finally, open an SSH session on your server. From your local terminal, run

```
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_chameleon cc@A.B.C.D
```

where

* in place of `~/.ssh/id_rsa_chameleon`, substitute the path to your own key that you had uploaded to CHI@TACC
* in place of `A.B.C.D`, use the floating IP address you just associated to your instance.
